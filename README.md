 Developed a machine learning model to predict Parkinson’s disease using biomedical
measurements. Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing features, and
balancing data using SMOTE.
Implemented ML techniques, including Boosting (AdaBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting),
Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Naïve Bayes.
Optimized models using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluated model performance through F1-score, Accuracy, Precision, and ROC-AUC Curve.
